<h1>The Best Movies According to Oscar </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>This is the best movie because it has all that you can ask for in Movie.<br />
 Action, romance, suspence, drama, adventure, and more.<br />
</p>
<h3>Shreck</h3>
<p>Funny as hell. Specially in Spanish.</p>
<h3>Schindler's List</h3>
<p>The motion picture on this movie is top notch. <br />
It's very sad, but it gives the viewers a better understanding of the holocaust.<br />
